| Concept                         | What It Means                                                     | Interview Tip                                            |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Mean**                        | Average of all values.                                            | Sensitive to outliers.                                   |
| **Median**                      | Middle value when sorted.                                         | Robust to outliers.                                      |
| **Variance**                    | Average squared deviation from mean.                              | Measures spread of data.                                 |
| **Standard Deviation (SD)**     | Square root of variance.                                          | In same units as data.                                   |
| **Skewness**                    | Measure of asymmetry.                                             | >0 = right-skewed (tail right), <0 = left-skewed.        |
| **Kurtosis**                    | Measure of tail heaviness.                                        | >3 = heavy tails, <3 = light tails (vs normal).          |
| **Central Limit Theorem (CLT)** | Sampling distribution of the mean → normal as n↑.                 | Foundation for hypothesis testing.                       |
| **p-value**                     | Probability of observing result ≥ test statistic if null is true. | Smaller p → stronger evidence against H₀.                |
| **Type I Error (α)**            | Reject true null (false positive).                                | Controlled by significance level.                        |
| **Type II Error (β)**           | Fail to reject false null (false negative).                       | Inversely related to power (1−β).                        |
| **Confidence Interval (CI)**    | Range of plausible population parameters.                         | 95% CI → in 95% of samples, true mean lies within range. |
