The daily returns of stocks is tracked on daily basis - A cron which runs daily at 12 midnight and 
fetches the stocks. So closing prices are converted to pct_change with pandas library.
Create features using sciPy lib to calc features 
like moving average rsi bollinger bands 
and check if its actually normal distribution using shapiro kurtosis skew
use Garch model or std dev to calc volatility 
and then feed this to the using sikit learn to models like lstm xgboost and random foerst.

The daily returns are tracked.
The bell curve in blue - Its normal distribution of data — the world of natural variation.
It’s how we can understand volatility, calculate Value-at-Risk, 
and measure the portfolio's typical performance.
*AI connection:* These returns become **features** for the predictive models. 
This is used to detect when the market is calm, and when turbulence is coming.


Every trade the algorithm makes is a test — success or failure,
profit or loss. Out of ten trades, some win, some don’t. 
That's the **Binomial world**.”
It doesn't just count wins; it learns **why** trades succeed.
Each trade's probability of success becomes a signal. 
We can feed this data into a ML classifier that predicts whether the next trade is worth taking.
*AI connection:* Supervised learning is used — 
models trained on historical trade data — to improve strategy accuracy, filter out noise, 
and adapt to evolving market regimes.



Now, let’s talk about risk. Defaults, system failures, fraud attempts — 
these events are rare but critical.
It can be modelled with the **Poisson distribution** —
events that happen independently over time, at a constant average rate.”
The AI platform monitors these counts in real time.
When the frequency suddenly exceeds what’s expected,
the anomaly detection module triggers alerts 
before small cracks become systemic risks.”

*AI connection:*
These Poisson-driven risk counts feed into predictive models 
— Poisson regression, anomaly detectors, and neural networks 
— that forecast crisis likelihood and allocate capital defensively.

So visually:
Skyblue curve (Normal): smooth bell shape — infinite possible values
Lightgreen dots (Binomial): probabilities for 0–10 — discrete trials
Orange dots (Poisson): right-skewed counts — event frequency data
