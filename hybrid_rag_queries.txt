In a Hybrid RAG, Neo4j handles structured knowledge graphs (entities + relations), while Weaviate stores semantic vectors (text embeddings).
To make this powerful, you need practical Cypher (Neo4j) and GraphQL/gRPC (Weaviate) queries that:
retrieve, explore, or rank data,
verify embeddings,
check relationships,
perform hybrid fusion (semantic + symbolic),
monitor health & schema.
